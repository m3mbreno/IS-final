    <h3 id="ab">About Butterflies</h3> 
    <p>I love butterflies! I think that they are beautiful insect and are super interesting to learn about. Did you know that there are about 17,500 species of butterflies in the world, and around 750 species in the United States? Butterflies are fascinating insects that undergo a remarkable transformation called metamorphosis. Their life cycle consists of four stages: egg, caterpillar (larva), pupa (chrysalis), and adult butterfly. This process begins when a female butterfly lays her eggs on specific plants that will serve as food for the emerging caterpillars. Once the egg hatches, a caterpillar emerges and begins to feed voraciously, growing rapidly and shedding its skin several times to accommodate its increasing size.

    After a period of feeding, the caterpillar forms a protective casing around itself known as a chrysalis. Inside this pupal stage, the caterpillar undergoes incredible changes at a cellular level, ultimately transforming into an adult butterfly. The duration of this stage varies depending on the species and environmental conditions.
    
    Finally, the adult butterfly emerges from the chrysalis, with beautifully patterned wings that are often vividly colored. Butterflies play crucial roles in ecosystems as pollinators, aiding in the reproduction of many flowering plants. They are also indicators of environmental health, as changes in their populations can reflect alterations in their habitats.
    
    Studying butterflies not only provides insights into their unique life cycle but also fosters an appreciation for the intricate connections between organisms and their environments.Learn more about butterflies though this website!</p>

   <h3  id="fa"> Here are important facts about butterflies that maybe you didn't know!</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Wings</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Butterflies have transparent wings made of thousands of miniature scales. The colors you see are the reflection of the many different colors in their scale</li>
        </ul>

    <li>Legs</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Butterflies have six jointed legs.</li>
        </ul>

    <li>Body Parts</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The three body parts of a butterfly are the head, thorax (chest), and abdomen (tail end).</li>
        </ul>

     <li>Antennae</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Butterflies have antennae that are sensory organs that help with balance, detect motion, and pick up chemicals in the air.
            </li>
        </ul>

     <li>Taste</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Butterflies taste with their feet, which have taste receptors. Females will taste the leaves of different plants until they find the host plant where they will lay their eggs.</li>
        </ul>

    <li>Proboscis</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Butterflies have a long tongue, called a proboscis, which they can curl and uncurl to drink through like a straw. They mainly eat sweet nectar from flowers.</li>
        </ul>

     <li>Color</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Butterflies have the most vibrant colors of all time. They absorb light and wavelengths which help to have different colors.</li>
        </ul>

    <li>Poison</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Some butterflies are poisonous. When a predator, like a bird, eats one of these butterflies it becomes sick, vomits violently, and quickly learns not to eat this type of butterfly.</li>
        </ul>
</ol>
